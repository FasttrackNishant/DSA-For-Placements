Vector:-

when we declare Array we have to predefine the size of the array
then you can not extend it 

in C++ && int main()
we can define the size of the array at max 10 ^6


- for int , char ,double
int arr[1000000];  --> inside the main --> 10^6
int arr[10000000]  --> globally the size --> 10^7

-for boolean

bool arr[10000000] --> inside the main --> 10^7

bool arr[100000000] --> globally the size--> 10^8

~~~~~~~~~~~


push_back(0)  --> it will insert 0 in the Vector

pop_back()    --> it will remove last element

the size constarints are same as the arrya but they can be dynamically reached and if the arr size if readched it will give *** segmentation error / segmentation fault *** 


vec.clear()  --> it will erase all the elements at once

emplace_back(1)  --> it is same as push_back but it takes lesser time than the push_back
