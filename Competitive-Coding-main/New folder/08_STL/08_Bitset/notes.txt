segment tree problems

int --> takes 16 bits
char --> 8 bits

bitset <10> bt;
it only stores 1 and 0 

there is array named bt which indexes from 0 to 9 and takes value only 1


all() -> this function is taken by 

if all elements are set in bt i.e all are 1 then it returen true
and if any one is 0 then it retures false



//any 
if minimum any of one bit is set then it prints true


count
it will print the number of set bits

flip
it flips the bit by 1 to 0 and 0 to one at that index

none
if no one is set then it will  give true
