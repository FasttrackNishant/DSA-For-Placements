we should use

~~~Array

-> arr.fill(3)
    // it will fill all the elements at the three 


-> arr.at(index)
it will get the element at that index



-> Iterators

begin()  -> it will assign to first index

end()    -> it is not exactly end it will point to the empty address next to rbegin

rbegin() -> reverse begin : it will point to the last

rend()   -> it is the position before the start..

auto --> whatever datatype it has it automatically detects it 

arr.size()  -->gives size of an Array 

arr.front() --> gives first element

arr.back()  --> gives last element
