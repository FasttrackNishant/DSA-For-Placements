Map  -> it is certain like a dictonary

    map<string, int> mpp;
    mpp["raj"] =27;
    mpp["hima"] =31;
    mpp["sandeep"] =67;
    mpp["tank"] =89;
    mpp["raj"] =29;


map only stores unique keys it will not store raj whose value is 27 it will overiten by 29

map will store like 
(hima, 31)
(raj , 29)
(sandeep, 67)
(tank, 89)
