Set is used to store the elements 
and it is used to find the unique elements

set of anything can be defined and it stores unique value

All operations of set are logarithmic of size

st.insert();  --> it is similar to the push _back
it takes log(N) , where N is the size of set

st.emplace()  -> same as insert


in set first element is smallest of all
st[0]--> can not access like this
to access we have to use iterators
st.begin()


all techniques implemented on vector can be done here 

it = st.find(n)  -> giver the iterators present at N
and if n is not in set

it = st.find(n)  --> it will return 
it = st.end()

avg complexity is log(n);

unordered_set <int> st;
avg time complexity in avg in nature 
but worst case is linear nature --> o(set size)
we never know will element will be at 0


** but in int , cp what should we use

if you dont require to stor in asceding order 
then use unordered_set as its complexity is better than log n

while using unordered_set we may get tle 
then switch to the set

~~~ Multiset

it is same like the set but we can store double values it sorted order
